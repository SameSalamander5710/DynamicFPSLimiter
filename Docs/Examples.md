# Example images

> [!NOTE]
> The example images below are not intended as direct comparisons. They are meant to demonstrate how different frame rate step values affect FPS adjustment behavior. Other settings may also differ between examples.

## Example 1 — Frame Rate Step: 5 FPS
- Offers more noticeable changes in FPS
- Returns to the maximum FPS cap more quickly

</p>

## Example 2 — Frame Rate Step: 2 FPS
- Provides finer, more precise control over FPS limits
- Maintains GPU usage more consistently within the target range
- Slower recovery to higher FPS caps after a drop
